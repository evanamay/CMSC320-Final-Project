##### Valentyn Bolotin, Jacob Barats, Evan May

### Introduction
Info goes here
### Data collection/curation + parsing and Data management
1. What imports did we use
2. Code used to import the data
3. Explanations of what the columns mean (the important columns that we will use)
4. Did we need to parse the data at all?
5. Show how we checked if there were any missing values and how we handled them
6. Did we need to tidy the data/remove unnessesary data
### Exploratory data analysis
1. How did we want to display the data
2. Code of displaying data
3. Graphs/Charts of displayed data
(THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE OF THESE GROUP OF THREE SECTIONS)
### Hypothesis testing
1. Conduct hypothesis testing
2. Show results in multiple formats (graphs, data, etc)
(THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE OF THESE GROUP OF TWO SECTIONS)
### Communication of insights attained
1. Descirbe what this data means (give multiple interpretations)
2. Give reasoning as to why the results were like this (any error that could have influenced results?)
3. Conclusion
